# VBA Homework - The VBA of Wall Street

## Objective

Analyze three years (2014-2016) of stock market data from .xlsx document utilizing recently obtained VBA scripting knowledge.


### Steps

1. Opened Github to create a new repository called 'Givens_VBA_challenge` for this project.

2. Navigated in terminal to the homework VU Documents folder and cloned the new respository.

3. While still inside my local respository, typed command <mkdir VBAstocks> to create a directory for to house any VBA files that will hold the scripts for each analysis.

4. While working again in terminal a couple days after first configuring the new repository I rain into "refusing to merge unrelated histories" error while attempting to push updates. Final solution was to create a new repository and git add all existing working files. 

5. Finally pushed the above changes to GitHub repo.
