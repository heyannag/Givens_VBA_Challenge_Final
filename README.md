# VBA Homework - The VBA of Wall Street

## Objective

Analyze three years (2014-2016) of stock market data from .xlsx document utilizing recently obtained VBA scripting knowledge.


### Steps

1. Opened Github to create a new repository called 'Givens_VBA_challenge` for this project.

2. Navigated in terminal to the homework VU Documents folder and cloned the new respository.

3. While still inside my local respository, typed command <mkdir VBAstocks> to create a directory for to house any VBA files that will hold the scripts for each analysis.

4. While working again in terminal a couple days after first configuring the new repository I rain into "refusing to merge unrelated histories" error while attempting to push updates. 

5. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

### Files

* [Test Data](Resources/alphabetical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing your scripts.

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final homework report.

## Instructions

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

* The result should look as follows.

### CHALLENGES

1. Your solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". The solution will look as follows:

2. Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.

### Other Considerations

* Use the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing your code. This data set is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 3-5 minutes.

* Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.

## Submission

* To submit please upload the following to Github:

  * A screen shot for each year of your results on the Multi Year Stock Data.

  * VBA Scripts as separate files.

* After everything has been saved, create a sharable link and submit that to <https://bootcampspot-v2.com/>.
